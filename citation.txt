Mr. Aiello

What I asked: 

I asked about an error that occured when I initianted an object in my Runner class and how it would 
display a huge error text. I also about an error that occured when I ran a maxIntelligence method in the Prompter class.



What Response I recieved:

For the first problem I was told that in the text files and dataset there were areas that were blank and needed to be filled with a value. 
Once I filled it out the problem was fixed. Next, for the second problem I was just using the wrong method and because of that it displayed
an error in the programming

Who helped me:
Chatgpt

What I asked: 

In the prompter class the method which prints out all the avaliable geological periods kept printing Unknown, ?, Duplicates,
and sometimes it would not work, so after a while I asked Chatgpt for some help

What Response I recieved: 

Chatgpt told me to include a for loop which would loop through everything in the dinosaur array and grabs its geological period, an if statement 
which checks whether the current period has already been printed and if it hasnt then it prints it, another if statement which 
prevents a blank line from printing before the first period as weall as making sure to print on a new line using \n, finally a block of code 
which would add the period to a periodsPrinted so it won’t print again later.
